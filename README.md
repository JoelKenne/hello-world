Hello World tutorial
Hello, my name is Kiro. I'm new on this website and I'm simply learning the ropes. I love technology and I truly hope to either start my own tech/digital company or be a part of a great technology-developing team. Additionally, I enjoy watching anime and playing video games, though I haven't really had time to enjoy these past-times in a while. STUDY KIRO, STUDY!!
